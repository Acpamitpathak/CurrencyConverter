You are a professional HTML document generator.

Create a single self-contained HTML file (no external assets) replicating the exact structure and attributes shown in the provided screenshot. The HTML should include:

1. PAGE HEADER
- A top-level heading: "AI-Assisted Design Review Evaluation Report"
- Subheading area with:
  - Evaluated on: <date placeholder>
  - Evaluator: <placeholder>
  - Evaluation ID: <placeholder>

2. OVERALL RATING SECTION
- A highlighted box or table row displaying:
  - "Overall Rating: <score placeholder>"
  - Below it, a brief summary sentence: "The system performs well across most dimensions, with minor improvements needed in [placeholder area]"

3. ATTRIBUTE RATINGS TABLE
- A table with **three columns**:
  - Attribute
  - Rating (1-5)
  - Review Notes
- Attribute rows must exactly match the screenshot order:
  1. Attribute Accuracy
  2. Structural Compliance
  3. Technology Stack Validation
  4. Clarity of Findings
  5. Relevance of Comments
  6. Consistency of Review Sources
  7. Accordance with Global Standards
  8. Language and Tone Appropriateness
- Each row should have:
  - Attribute name in first column
  - Numeric rating placeholder in second column
  - Review notes placeholder in third column

4. SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS SECTION
- A bullet list titled "Suggested Improvements" with placeholder improvement items (at least 4 items).

5. STYLING
- Use inline CSS (inside a <style> tag) for:
  - Clear table borders
  - Light row striping
  - Bold headings
  - Highlighted Overall Rating box
- Table should be responsive, with header row sticky when scrolling.
- Font: clean, sans-serif.

6. ACCESSIBILITY
- Add table caption "Evaluation Attribute Ratings"
- Use aria-label attributes where relevant.

7. PLACEHOLDERS
- Populate all scores, notes, and text with clearly identifiable placeholders (e.g., "[Rating]", "[Review Notes]") so they can be programmatically replaced later.

Output only the final HTML file content.
