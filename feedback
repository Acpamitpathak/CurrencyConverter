I’ve had the opportunity to work with Akhil in two hackathons, and it has been a genuinely positive experience. He is extremely easy to work with and brings a calm, solution-oriented approach to everything he does.

Akhil handles multiple tasks effortlessly and ensures smooth coordination among all team members. He manages responsibilities efficiently without ever letting pressure show, maintaining clarity and focus throughout. He answers every question with patience and is always approachable, making collaboration seamless and productive.

What stands out the most is his proactive attitude and willingness to help — he's someone who not only solves problems but also inspires others to think in the same direction. Working with him has been both inspiring and educational.
